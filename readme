sound: pipewire
music dir: ~/muz

remember to run mpd before ncmpcpp
if socket already in use then it's fine, it means mpd is already running, you can run ncmpcpp
when in ncmpcpp don't panic because you don't see anything, press 2 and you'll see music in your path indicated in config file

for correctly visualizing music paths in ncmpcpp config file visualizer_fifo_path = "~/.config/ncmpcpp/mpd.fifo" must be the same as in the mpd.conf file in audio output, type "fifo", name "visualizer", and path "~/.config/ncmpcpp/mpd.fifo"
